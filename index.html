            The plant life originating in the semi-arid climates of Earth has amazing diversity; including wide color variety, spine menagerie, other-worldly leaf structures, delicately ornate flowers, and even plants that grow in mid-air. Take a look at these aloe, orchids, and air plants. They will brighten up any room, garden, or patio! What if your pottery could be just as diverse?

            Can you plant an aloe vera plant in a pineapple-shaped planter? Or maybe place an orchid in a pot with a beautiful floating geometric shape?  With air plants, you can put them anywhere, and even stack them to the heavens!

              Aloe plants grow in many colors and shapes, including variegated, spiny and/or thick leaves. The leaves are thick to help store water during drought periods, so they thrive as houseplants or in arid climates. Aloe vera is the most common species of aloe, and can be found in nearly any garden store.

            Ordinary Aloe can become a tropical centerpiece with the right pot.

            With PrintAPot's <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/582373178/aloe-pineapple-pot-pineapple-succulent">Golden Pineapple Pot</a>, you can make your aloe vera truly stand out. The Golden Pineapple Pot has an awesome tropical, warm aesthetic. The golden color is reminiscent of the softest, sweetest pineapple flesh you've ever tasted. Since aloe plants enjoy arid conditions and dry soil, there are also two large drainage holes on the bottom for keeping your aloe plants happy and healthy.

            Orchids are a widespread family of flowering plants, well known for the unique beauty of their blooms. Their flowers are typically aromatic and occur along a stem, or inflorescence. Their leaves split from the base of the plant to form a symmetric ladder of leaves rising to support the stems.

          <p>
            The intersecting geometric shapes that create the Modern Floating Planter are naturally complementary to orchids, and a host of other plant arrangements, including this succulent arrangement. Curving, flowing ribbons support the lofted square planter as it floats above the circular drainage tray.

              Not even a hurricane could overwater this planter.
          </p>
          <p>
              The drainage tray is removable with a twisting lock feature. These features allow excess water to be collected and reused to water other plants. This pot is so effective at water drainage that the 2017 Hurricane Irma rainstorms drained right out and the plants flourished despite being effectively overwatered for 5 days in a row.

              As a practical design with a modern simplistic aesthetic, the Stacking Air Plant Tower stands alone (or stacks together). Air plants can perch gently on top, or rest on the tray down below. We love placing a variety of air plants on top of large stacked formations (including crocheted plants).

            <p>This shape is extremely exciting to those who love to play with space, imagination, and limitless geometric formations. When handed to children, the shape's imaginative capacity and strength leads towards a hilarious and worry-free play session in imaginary cities, underwater hospitals, and off-world colony construction efforts.

              More than just a holder for Air Plants or an interstellar colonization tool, this also has a shallow dish perfect for paperclips and other collections of small objects to be organized on your desk. Keep a collection mini figurines on the small tray, and then let a beautiful air plant hover above like the canopy of a rain forest.  To top it off, the set can be endlessly expanded in any number of colors, formations, and heights. After all, fantastic planters are all about expressing you.
